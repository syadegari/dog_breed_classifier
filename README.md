# dog_human_classifier
Shows how to make a simple classifier for dog-human classification (binary) from existing datasets without duplicating data.
Combines all the images from humans and dogs (50-50) and draws from it a train and a test set). Still needs to add the validation set but the skeleton is there and will done later!
